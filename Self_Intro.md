# Intro 

Hi, Iâ€™m Thrishika, an Azure Data Engineer with 3 years of experience in building and managing data pipelines on the Azure cloud platform. I specialize in tools like Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Data Lake, where I design efficient and scalable solutions for both batch and real-time data processing.

I have strong expertise in using PySpark and SQL for data transformation, as well as automating workflows to ensure smooth data operations. I collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams using GitHub for version control and Jira for project tracking, ensuring timely delivery and high-quality data solutions.
